Objects, like records, are like a collection of named (possibly mutable) variables packaged in curly braces {}. But there are four key differences:

We define an object by using the object keyword.
We specify the visibility of the named variables with either the public or private keyword.
We specify the mutability of the named variables with either the let or var keyword.
Only public variables are part of the type of an object.
